        <h1 class="rot">Rule of Thirds</h1>
        <p class="rot-organization">
            The rule of thirds was invented by a man named John Thomas Smith in the year of 1797.
            This rule is a guideline to think of your image as split into thirds, and display
            your content/subject in the left or right third of the space.

        <p>
            Design webkit is a good example of rule of thirds because its layout is nice and easy to navigate,
            and it displays ample examples of the rule of thirds and how to implement it in design.

        <h1 class="white-space">White Space and Clean Design</h1>
        <p class="white-space-organization">
            White space is important in clean design because it indicates spaces between words or other content.
            This helps things to look clean and tidy when you read it.

        <img id="white-space-img" src="images/white-space-page.png" alt="quip">
        <p class="quip">
            Quip is a good example of white space because it has enough space between each item/link that it is easy
            to tell what is going on and where things belong. It is pleasant to look at and easy to navigate.

        <h1 class="alignment">Alignment</h1>
        <p class="alignment-organization">
            Proper alignment is imperative in web development. If a page isn't properly aligned, it will be
            very hard to read and very confusing. When items are properly aligned, there is enough space around
            items to know exactly where they belong, and readability is increased.

        <img id="alignment-img" src="images/youtube-page.png" alt="youtube">
        <p class="youtube">
            YouTube is a good example of alignment because the videos are aligned in a nice grid pattern that is
            pleasing to look at and easy to navigate. The thumbnails are all the same size, and everything looks
            very clean and elegant.
