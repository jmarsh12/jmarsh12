            <h2>John Doe</h2>
            <p>
                John is an avid bird watcher. He loves to go outdoors and find the most exotic birds in the area.
                Instrumental to John is reliable weather information. If he looks up the weather and it says it will be
                sunny, but it's rainy, there won't be any birds out for him to see. He needs to know which days and times
                are best to go out.

            <h2>Jorge Tortilla</h2>
            <p>
                Jorge is a licensed drone pilot. He constantly needs to know what the weather is so he can know if his
                drone can handle the weather. In order to fly a drone, Jorge needs weather that is not windy, not too
                hot or too cold, and not wet. Drones can be very finicky when it comes to weather, so it's crucial for
                him to know the best weather info around.
