            October 4, 2008, during the church's 178th Semiannual general conference by LDS Church president
            Thomas S. Monson. When the announcement was made, Monson did not specify whether the temple would be
            constructed in Kansas or Missouri.[5] However, a later press release confirmed that the temple would be
            built in the Shoal Creek development in Clay County, Missouri, within the city boundaries of Kansas City.
            This was the second temple of the LDS Church built in Missouri, after the St. Louis Missouri Temple.

            <span class="bold_char">Temple History:</span><br />The Los Angeles Temple was announced on March 23, 1937,
            by church president Heber J. Grant, when the church purchased 24.23 acres (98,000 m2) from the Harold
            Lloyd Motion Picture Company. Construction was to begin soon thereafter, but financial difficulties
            relating to the Great Depression and World War II delayed the groundbreaking until 1951.[2] The temple
            plans were revised at this time to include a priesthood assembly room, an unusual feature in temples built
            after the Salt Lake Temple. It was also expanded to accommodate an unprecedented 300 patrons per session.
            It is the second-largest temple in the world.
